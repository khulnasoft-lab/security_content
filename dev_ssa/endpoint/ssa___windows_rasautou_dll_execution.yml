description: The following analytic identifies the Windows Windows Remote Auto Dialer,
  rasautou.exe executing an arbitrary DLL. This technique is used to execute arbitrary
  shellcode or DLLs via the rasautou.exe LOLBin capability. During triage, review
  parent and child process behavior including file and image loads.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search:
  selection1:
    process.file.name: rasautou.exe
  selection2:
    process.cmd_line|re: '-p '
  selection3:
    process.cmd_line|re: '-d '
  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives will be limited to applications that require
  Rasautou.exe to load a DLL from disk. Filter as needed.
