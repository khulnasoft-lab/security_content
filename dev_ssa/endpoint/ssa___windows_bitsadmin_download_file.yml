description: The following query identifies Microsoft Background Intelligent Transfer
  Service utility `bitsadmin.exe` using the `transfer` parameter to download a remote
  object. In addition, look for `download` or `upload` on the command-line, the switches
  are not required to perform a transfer. Capture any files downloaded. Review the
  reputation of the IP or domain used. Typically once executed, a follow on command
  will be used to execute the dropped file. Note that the network connection or file
  modification events related will not spawn or create from `bitsadmin.exe`, but the
  artifacts will appear in a parallel process of `svchost.exe` with a command-line
  similar to `svchost.exe -k netsvcs -s BITS`. It's important to review all parallel
  and child processes to capture any behaviors and artifacts. In some suspicious and
  malicious instances, BITS jobs will be created. You can use `bitsadmin /list /verbose`
  to list out the jobs during investigation.

search:
  selection1:
    process.cmd_line|contains: transfer
    process.file.name: bitsadmin.exe
  condition: (selection1)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives, however it may be required to filter
  based on parent process name or network connection.
