description: This analytic identifies the use of RemCom.exe - The open source psexec. This utility provides the ability to move laterally and run scripts or commands remotely.

- Windows Security 4688
search:
  selection1:
    process.cmd_line|contains:
    - '/user:'
    - '/pwd:'
    - '\\'
    process.file.name: remcom.exe
  condition: (selection1)
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: It is possible legitimate applications may perform this behavior
  and will need to be filtered.
