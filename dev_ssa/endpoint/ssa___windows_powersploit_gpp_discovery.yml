description: The following analytic identifies the use of the Get-GPPPassword PowerShell commandlet employed to search for unsecured credentials Group Policy Preferences (GPP).
  GPP are tools that allow administrators to create domain policies with embedded credentials. These policies allow administrators to set local accounts.
  These group policies are stored in SYSVOL on a domain controller. This means that any domain user can view the SYSVOL share and decrypt the password (using the AES key that has been made public).
  While Microsoft released a patch that impedes Administrators to create unsecure credentials, existing Group Policy Preferences files with passwords are not removed from SYSVOL.
