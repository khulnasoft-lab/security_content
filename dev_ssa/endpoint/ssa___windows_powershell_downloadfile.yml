description: The following analytic identifies the use of PowerShell downloading a
  file using `DownloadFile` method. This particular method is utilized in many different
  PowerShell frameworks to download files and output to disk. Identify the source
  (IP/domain) and destination file and triage appropriately. If AMSI logging or PowerShell
  transaction logs are available, review for further details of the implant.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search:
  selection1:
    process.file.name:
    - powershell_ise.exe
    - powershell.exe
    - sqltoolsps.exe
    - sqlps.exe
    - pwsh.exe
    - pwsh.exe
  selection2:
    process.cmd_line|re: downloadfile
  condition: selection1 and selection2
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node. In addition,
  confirm the latest CIM App 4.20 or higher is installed and the latest TA for the
  endpoint product.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present and filtering will need to occur
  by parent process or command line argument. It may be required to modify this query
  to an EDR product for more granular coverage.
