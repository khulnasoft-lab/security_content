type: TTP
description: The following analytic identifies a recently disclosed arbitraty command
  execution using Windows msdt.exe - a Diagnostics Troubleshooting Wizard. The sample
  identified will use the ms-msdt:/ protocol handler to load msdt.exe to retrieve
  a remote payload. During triage, review file modifications for html. Identify parallel
  process execution that may be related, including an Office Product.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search:
  selection1:
    process.cmd_line|contains:
    - ms-msdt:/id
    - ms-msdt:-id
    - ms-msdt:/id
    - 'ms-msdt:'

  selection3:

  condition: selection1 and selection2 and selection3
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present, filter as needed. Added .xml
  to potentially capture any answer file usage. Remove as needed.
