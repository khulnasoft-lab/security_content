description: 'Certutil.exe may download a file from a remote destination using `-VerifyCtl`.
  This behavior does require a URL to be passed on the command-line. In addition,
  `-f` (force) and `-split` (Split embedded ASN.1 elements, and save to files) will
  be used. It is not entirely common for `certutil.exe` to contact public IP space.
  \ During triage, capture any files on disk and review. Review the reputation of
  the remote IP or domain in question. Using `-VerifyCtl`, the file will either be
  written to the current working directory or `%APPDATA%\..\LocalLow\Microsoft\CryptnetUrlCache\Content\<hash>`. '

how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search you need to be ingesting information
  on process that include the name of the process responsible for the changes from
  your endpoints into the `Endpoint` datamodel in the `Processes` node.
known_false_positives: Limited false positives in most environments, however tune
  as needed based on parent-child relationship or network connection.
