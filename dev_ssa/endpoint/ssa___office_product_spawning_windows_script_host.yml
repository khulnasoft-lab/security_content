description: The following analytic will identify a Windows Office Product spawning
  WScript.exe or CScript.exe. Tuning may be required based on legitimate application
  usage that may spawn scripts from an Office product.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search:
  selection1:
    process.file.name:
    - cscript.exe
    - wscript.exe
    actor.process.file.name|re:
    - visio.exe
    - mspub.exe
    - powerpnt.exe
    - excel.exe
    - winword.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positives may be present based on macro based approved
  documents in the organization. Filtering may be needed.
