description: The following analytic identifies the decompile parameter with the HTML
  Help application, HH.exe. This is a uncommon command to see ran and behavior. Most
  recently this was seen in a APT41 campaign where a CHM file was delivered and a
  script inside used a technique for running an arbitrary command in a CHM file via
  an ActiveX object. This unpacks an HTML help file to a specified path for launching
  the next stage.

search:
  selection1:
    process.cmd_line|contains: -decompile
    process.file.name: hh.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: False positives should be limited, filter as needed.
