description: The following analytic identifies child processes spawning from  "mshta.exe".
  The search will return the first time and last time these command-line arguments
  were used for these executions, as well as the target system, the user, parent process
  "mshta.exe" and its child process.
data_source:
- Windows Security 4688
search:
  selection1:
    process.file.name:
    - wscript.exe
    - cscript.exe
    - searchprotocolhost.exe
    - microsoft.workflow.compiler.exe
    - msbuild.exe
    - colorcpl.exe
    - scrcons.exe
    - cmd.exe
    - powershell.exe
    actor.process.file.name|endswith: mshta.exe
  condition: selection1
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA.
known_false_positives: Although unlikely, some legitimate applications may exhibit
  this behavior, triggering a false positive.
