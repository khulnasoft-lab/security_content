description: The following analytic detects the creation of local administrator accounts
  using the net.exe command to mitigate the risks associated with unauthorized access
  and prevent further damage to the environment by responding to potential threats
  earlier and taking appropriate actions to protect the organization's systems and
  data. This detection is made by a Splunk query to search for processes with the
  name net.exe or net1.exe that include the "/add" parameter in their process name.
  This detection is important because the creation of unauthorized local user accounts
  might indicate that an attacker has successfully created a new user account and
  is trying to gain persistent access to a system or escalate their privileges for
  data theft, or other malicious activities. False positives might occur since there
  might be legitimate uses of the net.exe command and the creation of user accounts
  in certain circumstances. You must consider the context of the activity and other
  indicators of compromise before taking any action. For next steps, review the details
  of the identified process, including the user, parent process, and parent process
  name. Examine any relevant on-disk artifacts and look for concurrent processes to
  determine the source of the attack.

search: ' $main = from source  | eval timestamp = time  | eval metadata_uid = metadata.uid  |
  eval process_pid = process.pid | eval process_file = process.file | eval process_file_path
  = process_file.path | eval process_file_name = lower(process_file.name) | eval process_cmd_line
  = process.cmd_line | eval actor_user = actor.user | eval actor_user_name = actor_user.name

  AND process_cmd_line LIKE "%/add%" AND (process_file_name IN ("net.exe", "net1.exe"))
  --finding_report--'
how_to_implement: To successfully implement this search, you need to be ingesting
  logs with the process name, parent process, and command-line executions from your
  endpoints. If you are using Sysmon, you must have at least version 6.0.4 of the
  Sysmon TA. Tune and filter known instances where renamed net.exe may be used.
known_false_positives: System administrators or scripts may add user accounts via
  this technique. Filter as needed.
